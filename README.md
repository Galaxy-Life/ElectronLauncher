## Development
Clone the repo like you would normally and run `npm install` the first time.

Whenever you make changes and want to test them out:
`npm run start`

If you want to build the project into executables (x64 versions for windows, linux, macos & darwin):
`npm run build`

To build x32 versions for windows and linux:
`npm run buildx32`
